Formulas

EXP requirement to reach level n
Level 2 = 1200 exp
Level 3-6 = 2000 exp
Level 7-11 = 3500 exp
Level 12-14 = 4700 exp
Level 15 = 6800 exp

1 creep = 100 exp (gives only to the opposite team's hero near that creep)
1 hero = 250 + 50*[target hero level] (gives globally to every heroes on the killing team)

Basic attack (spacebar) = 100% Physical attack

Skill's final damage = Skill's Damage * (Physical/Magical Damage multiplier)
Physical Damage multiplier = 100/(100+Phy.Def) if Phy.Def >= 0
Physical Damage multiplier = 2-{100/(100-Phy.Def)} if Phy.Def < 0
Magical Damage multiplier = 100/(100+Mag.Def) if Mag.Def >= 0
Magical Damage multiplier = 2-{100/(100-Mag.Def)} if Mag.Def < 0

Mana required for using skill = Mana_Constant_Lv1/Mana_Constant_Lv2/Mana_Constant_Lv3

Cooldown = ( CD_Lv1_constant/CD_Lv2_constant/CD_Lv3_constant ) * ( 100 - CD_Reduction ) / 100

Lifesteal : restore the attacker's health when using basic attack by 100% Attack Damamge * Lifesteal%


Sample Heroes

Level n hero's status consists of :
HP = Max Health, Max HP
MP = Max Mana, Max MP
HP Regeneration per 5 seconds (HP_Regen)
MP Regeneration per 5 seconds (MP_Regen)

Move Speed (MS) *How many second it takes to move once
Attack Range *How many block, from your hero, you can attack
Attack Speed (AS) *Attack speed's range is between 0 to 2, as a hero with n attack speed can perform basic attack once every n second
Cooldown Reduction (CD_Reduction)


Every status that increase when level up must be calculated by the following formula 
- Base Status + Growth Statistic * (n - 1) * (0.7025 + 0.0175 * (n-1))

The following status are written as Status = Base Status + (Growth Statistic) if the status does not has a growth statistic, then the status cannot be increase by leveling up
